- 👋 Hi, I’m @selina-hsueh. I'm working in a Japanese strawberry company which manage 60,000 m^2 of greenhouse with more than 420,000 strawberry plants in them
- 👀 I’m interested in making a automatic greenhouse based on climate/plant data 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Python as a beginner
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who are familiar with statistic, maching learning (R, Python) and insterested in Agriculture. We've collect climate and plant data for years, and still trying to figure out how to make great use of them.
